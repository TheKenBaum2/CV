			<h1>Hobbies</h1>
			<p>I love playing video games and watching anime.
			<br>I also love using <a href="https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mz">RPGMaker MZ</a> to make games.<ul>
				<li>An Example of two games I made are 'Desert Walk' and 'Nexus'.<br>
					<br><ul><li>'Desert walk' is a game where your spend weeks of IRL time walking through a massive desert while maintaining your hunger and thirst, made to be as boring and unfun as possible. This game has sense been deleted from my google drive for space reasons.
						<ul><br>Fun Fact: RPGMaker MZ uses a tile system for map making, with maps maxing out at 256x256 tiles in size, so in order to make the desert expansive enough, I made the map loop horizontally.<br>
						I also set up a variable that counts each time the map has looped and set it so once the map has looped <strong>9999 times</strong>, the game will cut to a 'You Win' Screen. To prevent players from cheating by just holding<br>
						down the 'move right' button, the game also ask you to drink water every 8 screen loops and eat some food every 13 screen loops, in which you have to do as the game ask before the screen loops again,<br>
						otherwise you got a game over. I also had a system where Cactus's were place randomly in the desert and would randomly change locations on each screen loop, this was to mask where each loop would happen.<br>
						Also, is a player just so happened to walk into a cactus, that was game over as well. I made this game in less than 4 hours.</li>
					</ul></ul><br>
					<ul><li>'Nexus' was a simple game where you started in a hub area which had portals that led you to other one screen rooms, with the goal of the game being to find a key to open the big door in the nexus.<br>
					The challenge of the game came from the obtuse puzzles I made and players figuring out which items to take from each rooms to solve puzzles in other rooms. This game was also deleted from google drive for space reasons.
						<ul><br>Fun Fact: I made this game in 19 hours, it was made with the intention of me making said game in less then 24 hours and I did it with time to spare.
					</li></ul>
				</li></ul>

			<br>I also browse both <a href="https://www.reddit.com">reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.4chan.org">4chan (Content Warning)</a>. I browse reddit regularly and 4chan when I am bored.
			<br>I also love eating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza">pizza</a>.</p>
