			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>I have a GED from 
				<a href="https://scc.spokane.edu/">
			Spokane Community College</a>, I got it around 2019 if I recall correctly.<br>
			I attended and subsequently dropped out of 
			<a href="https://jhs.lwsd.org/">
			Juanita Highschool</a>. <ul><li>(That's in 
				<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Juanita+High+School/@47.7160075,-122.2016923,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x54901276624da461:0x1436cb65e8f17e58!8m2!3d47.7160039!4d-122.1995036">
			Kirkland WA</a>).</li></ul>
			I have also dropped out of 
			<a href="https://sfcc.spokane.edu/">
			Spokane Falls Community College</a> and 
			<a href="https://www.snhu.edu/">
			SNHU</a>.<ul><li>(Spokane Falls is in

			Spokane, WA</a>)</li><li>(SNHU is in Southern New Hampshire, it was an online school and I am to lazy to look up the city it's in.)</li></ul>
			Apparently traditional schools aren't my thing.<br>
			I am having fun with 
				<a href="https://www.udemy.com/">
			Udemy</a> though.<ul><li>(Udemy is an website with paid-for classes, it's not a college but I do get certifications for completing classes.)</li></ul></p>
